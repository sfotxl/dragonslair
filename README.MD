# Dragons Lair Bootstrap Site
A Bootstrap-based responsive, mobile-first website for Dragon's Lair Smoked Fine Goods, a small business in the Houston area. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase skills learned in the Nucamp Bootstrap course, part of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Nucamp, taken in the Spring of 2022.

## Implementation
I used the original VistaPrint-built website the business had setup, which can be found [here](https://dragonslairjerky.com/)), as a starting point. 

The main goals in setting up the Bootstrap site were to 
1. Provide the user with a smooth, easily navigated flow of pertinent information.
2. Maintain simliar styling in fonts and color scheme to keep consistency in the business's branding. 
3. Make the site more visually appealing.
4. Highlight where to find the business, since an online store is beyond the scope of this project.
5. Get practice liasing with a client in creating a web-based product.

After wireframing the site and getting approval for the design of the site, I was able to achieve the goals of the project on time. The owner of the business was happy with the end product, but because it lacks a back-end could not commit to using it as principal website for the business.

## Future Features
The project lacks a back-end, which would be great for linking the contact form directly to the business. The site could use an open-source API to improve the Map feature, which is only a screenshot of an existing map.
